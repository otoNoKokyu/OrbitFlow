A software that really intrigued me was Atlassian JIRA. The more I was using JIRA, the more I was thinking how is this software is built beautifully with so many deeply complex features.From a long time I was thinking of building something like JIRA. While it's impossible for me to clone the whole buiness features of JIRA, here I am trying to mimic some part of JIRA With fairly complex workflow and user management. Its a Project Management Software. Building on Monolith as of now. I have the desire to make it atleast a multitenant application if not a microservice. I'm naming it OrbitFlow.
